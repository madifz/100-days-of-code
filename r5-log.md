### R5D62-86 (27/9-21/10 2022)

- Been quite a blur in the past 2 weeks or so as I adjust working in a startup. Managed to barely keep up with small bits of coding daily. Now up to end of Stage 4 (JetBrains Academy Intro to Command Line and Unix Shell) but stuck at the stage converter project. Working on it this weekend.

- Have been stuck this past long weekend with the JetBrains Academy [Linux Intro Stage 4 project](https://github.com/madifz/linux_intro/blob/main/hyperskill_linux_stage4). Website keeps giving me error "Wrong answer in test #4 Test failed!" but testing on my local machine threw no errors. I bountied my question to see if other learners can figure where I went wrong. Finally managed to resolve after someone pointed out that definitions.txt do not need each line tp be indexed.

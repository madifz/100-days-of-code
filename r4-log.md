### R4D1 (21/3/22)

- Round 4 #100DaysOfCode restart. Dropped off end-Feb/early-Mar due to work, picking up from where I left off + also learning some Linux (freeCodeCamp intro and then playing around with a RPi4).

### R4D2-3 (30/3/22)

- Putting pause on round 4 of #100DaysOfCode. Been busy reviewing React, learning magento/sfcc/prestashop for work and also helping a friend prep for tech interviews, so have not really been able to restart properly. Will probably restart at the same time when I also start my part-time web and programming diploma course; weâ€™re starting with Python so really looking forward to re-learning it.

### R4D1 (21/3/22)

### R4D2-3 (30/3/22)
- Putting pause on round 4 of #100DaysOfCode. Been busy reviewing React, learning magento/sfcc/prestashop for work and also helping a friend prep for tech interviews, so have not really been able to restart properly. Will probably restart at the same time when I also start my part-time web and programming diploma course; weâ€™re starting with Python so really looking forward to re-learning it.
